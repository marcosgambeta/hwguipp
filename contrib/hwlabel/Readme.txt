1. Preface
----------
"Label" is an important feature in business applications for
example to label envelopes of letters to customers.
In CLLOG [1] it is necessary for labelling QSL cards.
The label feature is supported by Harbour for console 
applications and needs direct access to the printer port.
Also it is necessary, to write printer control sequences
only for your used printer model into the label file.
In some implementations, the printer control codes are
stored in a printer database, this is implemented in CLLOG [1].
So this strategy is outdated.

The label editor is almost implememented in Clipper
in the utility RL.EXE, in S'87 as LABEL.EXE.
You can find an open source implementation for a Harbour
console application in the application "CLLOG",
file "lbledit.prg" in directory "src".
Link to CLLOG [1] see chapter "Internet links"

"hwlabel" is the port of this feature to HWGUI by using the WinPrn class,
so it is ready for multi platform usage and independent from
the used printer model.


1.1 Prerequisites
-----------------

For using this module you need a Harbour release supporting
the codepage "CP858" for Euro currency sign. This codepage
supports latin for most western countries like codepages
CP 437 and CP850.

It is very easy to check for this:
Compile and run the following HWGUI sample:
hwgui\samples\testfunc.prg

Then press button "hwg_Has_Win_Euro_Support":
If the value "True" is returned, the used Harbour version is OK.
Otherwise you need to get the recent Harbour version.

On LINUX there must be the same prerequisite, because this
codepage is used for the coding in the label file.
 

2. The Label Editor
-------------------

The Label Editor utility is needed to create and edit label files.
This utility is a "designer" for labels.
Label files have the extension ".lbl" and a fixed size of 1034 bytes.
The source code for the label editor is found in file "hwlbledt.prg".


For compatibility to Clipper, the codepage for label files is CP858DE.
It is the same as CP850 with one exception:
The Euro currency sign is 0xD5 or CHR(213).
This is suitable for most western languages.
More codepage support is planned for future versions of HWLABEL.
CP850/CP858 is more compatible as the early used CP437 for multi language use.

The basic version of "hwlabel" supports the english (default) and german language.
Feel free to extend the source code of hwlabel with new languages.
You can send us the extended code via a new support ticket or E-mail.

The label editor contains a help function, with
references for parameters and contents.

You can insert the label editor in your own HWGUI application.
The instructions are found in the inline comment of hwlbledt.prg.

A console version of the label editor is also available as
"lbledit.prg", compile it with 
hbmk2 lbledit.prg.

Also an additional advice:
The used codepages and language setting must be passed in the main program of the label editor:
FUNCTION hwlabel_lbledit(clangf,cCpLocWin,cCpLocLINUX,cCpLabel)
The description of these parameters and the default values can be found in the inline comments of
function "hwlabel_translcp()".


3. Sample program
-----------------

The sample database "customer.dbf" contains 1 record with typical
data for customer contact:
Title, Name, Street, Postcode, Town , State , Country , Account

A sample label file "sample.lbl" is used for print an
adress from the database "customer.dbf".


Der following sample call show, how to print out a label of the recent
database record redirected into a file:

   LABEL FORM (l_lbl);
      TO FILE (ctempoutfile) ;    && .txt
      RECORD RECNO()

Function reference for use in label file see Appendix, Table 3


4. Build programs
-----------------

You need two build calls for label editor and sample program:

MinGW32:
  hwmk.bat hwlbledt.prg
  hwmk.bat hwlblsample.prg

With the "hbmk2" utility (LINUX and Windows):
 hbmk2 hwlbledt.hbp
 hbmk2 hwlblsample.hbp

 
 
5. Additional information
-------------------------

For the next issue of hwlabel:

- Macro interpreter, need for call of method
  SetMode im label contents.
  So you can modify character size, type and character set.

- Support of Euro currency sign:
  Euro = CHR(128) at nCharset = 0, but not all
  Umlaute can be printed. This is only possible,
  if the macro interpreter is realized.

Functions for label printing 
(Function reference for use in label file)

 Shortened functions for label printing and filter strings
 (saves space):

 FUNCTION   A                 && (C)  ALLTRIM(s)
 FUNCTION   S                 && (C)  SPACE(n)
 FUNCTION   P                 && (C)  PADRIGHT(s,n)
 FUNCTION   C                 && (C)  CHR(n)
 FUNCTION   R                 && (C)  REPLICATE(s,n)
 FUNCTION   T                 && (C)  TRANSFORM(s,p)
 FUNCTION   NOSKIP            && (C)  gibt ein Zeichen 255 aus, wenn leer


FUNCTION NOSKIP(e):

Returns CHR(255), not printable,
if e (a string) is empty.
Otherwise the value of e is returned
is passed.

Reason:
Lines defined in label file, but
left empty are not printed.
It seems, that this line is not
existing. This causes an
misfunction in the design,
the following lines are moved to top.
