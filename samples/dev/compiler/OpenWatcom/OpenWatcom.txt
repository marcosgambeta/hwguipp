- Create install directory C:\WATCOM (default installation path).
- Extract archive "ow-snapshot.tar.gz" into a temporary directory.
- Move or copy the following directories to install directory:
   - binnt   (32bit) 
   - binnt64 (64bit)
   - eddat
   - l
   - lh
   - lib386
   
But you can also extract the complete archive here.
 
Prerequisites

You need GNU make, install it in c:\make.
The binary "make.exe" must be found in subdir "bin".
