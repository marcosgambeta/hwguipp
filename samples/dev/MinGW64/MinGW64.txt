 Additional Information for MinGW64 port:
 
 Troubleshooting port a HWGUI application to MinGW 64 bit (x86_64) compiler:
 

 1.) At program start the error message "0xc000007b" appreared. This is caused by mixed
     object files (32 and 64 bit) in the exe file, and that does not work !
     The linker (ld) does not detect, that the delivered object files are mixed.
     Screenshot of message see file "starterr7b.png".
     This is caused by different topics.
 
 2.) Resource compiler "windres":
     - Hex values in .rc file not supported any more (see samples\a.rc).
     - Backslash character "\" must be written as "\\".
     - The option "-F pe-x86-64" create a 64 bit object file. If the error message
       "0xc000007b" appreared at program start,
       you use a manifest file with invalid values (for 32 bit).
       First try to remove the inclusion of a manifest file.


 3.) Library "pcre" (Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions) is not ready for 64 bit !
     It was realized, that some function calls of Harbour/HWGUI needed pcre. 
     A list of this functions:
     hb_ini*() of Harbour: src\rtl\hbini.prg
     If you try to build your application and get the following unresolved symbols from libhbrtl.a
     at linking, you used such a function:
       - pcre_compile
       - pcre_exec
       - pcre_config
       - pcre_stack_free
       - pcre_stack_malloc
       - pcre_free
    It seems, that the linker ignores not used symbols, so that a lot of the sample programs are running
    on 64 bit environment and the missing pcre library has no effect.
    In application CLLOG, file "libini.prg", there is a workaround for this case
    (Handling Windows like ini files for multi platform purposes).
    Read instructions in comment line.
 
 4.) hbmk2 does not work properly, so that "0xc000007b" appears here again.
     Use only script "bldmingw64.bat" for building a sample.

 5.) Build HWGUI:
     Use only script "makemngw64.bat".
     A lot of warnings appeared, ignore them, to fix them, it is a lot of work to to.

     we need some casts to add.
     Sample: ( HMENU ) hb_parni( 2 ) to ( HMENU )( UINT_PTR ) hb_parni( 2 )

 6.) Bug in BUTTON: BACKCOLOR has no effect, works best on 32 bit.
 
 
 But in general, it is possible to port some applications to 64bit. See file "samples\Readme.txt".
 
 ============= TO-DO ========================
 - Add lot of casts for 64 bit in HWGUI source code
 - Create ticket for PCRE group for port to 64bit.
 - Check 64bit for Cross Development Environment
 - Build scripts for other components (utils,contrib)
