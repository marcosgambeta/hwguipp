DbcH - Data Base Control (Harbour) is an utility that allows complete multi-user access to xBASE databases and indexes.

Here you can download the following binaries and sources:

Console version:

    Dbch 3.10 ( Windows ) supports DBFCDX (default) and DBFNTX drivers;
    Dbch 3.10_Debian ( Linux Debian 7 ) supports DBFCDX (default) and DBFNTX drivers;
    Dbchl 3.10 ( Windows ) a version for LetoDB;
    Dbchx 3.9 ( Windows ) supports Ads RDD. To use it you need to have ADS client dll's version 5.7 .
     You can download it from here.
    DbcH 3.10 - sources. Bat files to build DbcH with Borland C compiler and dbc.hbp for hbmk2 are included; 

GUI version:

    Dbchw 3.2 ( Windows ) for local files (DBFCDX,DBFNTX).
    The sources are included in HwGUI distribution( hwgui/utils/dbc ).

Pay attention to the file dbc.ini. It has the same set of options for console and GUI versions. DbcH first reads the ini-file, located near the executable file, and then the one that is in the directory from which you launched DbcH, so you can override Dbc options for different directories.
